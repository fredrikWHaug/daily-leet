# daily-leet
My daily effort to practice algorithmic thinking.

I spend roughly 10 minutes per day trying to solve a leetcode problem aligned with the map outlined by NeetCode (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgQjes7MgTM&t=78s).

I just keep all the code I write for the problems in this repository.
